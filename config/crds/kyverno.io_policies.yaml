                                      request. The value is null for DELETE requests.
                                      - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value
                                      is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes
                                      of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)).
                                      - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to
                                      by the policy binding being evaluated. Only
                                      populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject'
                                      - The namespace object that the incoming object
                                      belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped
                                      resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited

                                      value. For example, a variable named 'foo' can
                                      be accessed as 'variables.foo'. - 'authorizer'

                                      of the request. See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz

                                      a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'.
                                      The keywords are: \"true\", \"false\", \"null\",

                                          rule fails. Since messageExpression is used
                                          as a failure message, it must evaluate to
                                          a string. If both message and messageExpression
                                          are present on a validation, then messageExpression
                                          will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression
                                          results in a runtime error, the runtime
                                          error is logged, and the validation failure
                                          message is produced as if the messageExpression
                                          field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates
                                          to an empty string, a string with only spaces,
                                          or a string that contains line breaks, then
                                          the validation failure message will also
                                          be produced as if the messageExpression
                                          field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression
                                          produced an empty string/string with only
                                          spaces/string with line breaks will be logged.
                                          messageExpression has access to all the
                                          same variables as the `expression` except
