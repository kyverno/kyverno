                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions
                      like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                      or "name must be restricted".     Those cannot be well described
                      when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                      are different, the validation rules are different by usage,
                      which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4.
                      The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                      a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during
                      interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                      dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change
                      it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                      to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make
                      new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                      Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used
                      type that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                      for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533
