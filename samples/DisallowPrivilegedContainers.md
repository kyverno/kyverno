# Diallow privileged containers

Privileged containers are defined as any container where the container uid 0 is mapped to the hostâ€™s uid 0. A process within a privileged container can get unrestricted host access. With `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` enabled, a process can gain privileges from its parent.

To disallow privileged containers and privilege escalation, run pod containers with `securityContext.privileged` set to `false` and `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`.
