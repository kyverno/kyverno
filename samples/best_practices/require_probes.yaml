    policies.kyverno.io/description: Liveness and readiness probes need to be configured to 
      correctly manage a pods lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. For each 
      pod, a periodic `livenessProbe` is performed by the kubelet to determine if the pod's 
      containers are running or need to be restarted. A `readinessProbe` is used by services 
      and deployments to determine if the pod is ready to recieve network traffic.
