    policies.kyverno.io/description: Linux allows defining fine-grained permissions using
      capabilities. With Kubernetes, it is possible to add capabilities that escalate the
      level of kernel access and allow other potentially dangerous behaviors. This policy 
      enforces that containers cannot add new capabilities. Other policies can be used to set
      default capabilities.
