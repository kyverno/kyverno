## About

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) is a Kubernetes Native Policy Management engine.

It allows you to:
- Manage policies as Kubernetes resources (no new language required.)
- Validate, mutate, and generate resource configurations.
- Select resources based on labels and wildcards.
- View policy enforcement as events.
- Scan existing resources for violations.

This chart bootstraps a Kyverno deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Access the complete user documentation and guides at: https://kyverno.io.

## Installing the Chart

**IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT**

This chart changed significantly between `v2` and `v3`. If you are upgrading from `v2`, please read `Migrating from v2 to v3` section.

**Add the Kyverno Helm repository:**

```console
$ helm repo add kyverno https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/
```

**Create a namespace:**

You can install Kyverno in any namespace. The examples use `kyverno` as the namespace.

```console
$ kubectl create namespace kyverno
```

**Install the Kyverno chart:**

```console
$ helm install kyverno --namespace kyverno kyverno/kyverno
```

The command deploys Kyverno on the Kubernetes cluster with default configuration. The [installation](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/) guide lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

The Kyverno ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding that manages webhook configurations must have the suffix `:webhook`. Ex., `*:webhook` or `kyverno:webhook`.
Other ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding names are configurable.

**Notes on using ArgoCD:**

When deploying this chart with ArgoCD you will need to enable `Replace` in the `syncOptions`, and you probably want to ignore diff in aggregated cluster roles.

You can do so by following instructions in these pages of ArgoCD documentation:
- [Enable Replace in the syncOptions](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#replace-resource-instead-of-applying-changes)
- [Ignore diff in aggregated cluster roles](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/diffing/#ignoring-rbac-changes-made-by-aggregateroles)

ArgoCD uses helm only for templating but applies the results with `kubectl`.

Unfortunately `kubectl` adds metadata that will cross the limit allowed by Kubernetes. Using `Replace` overcomes this limitation.

Another option is to use server side apply, this will be supported in ArgoCD v2.5.

Finally, we introduced new CRDs in 1.8 to manage resource-level reports. Those reports are associated with parent resources using an `ownerReference` object.

As a consequence, ArgoCD will show those reports in the UI, but as they are managed dynamically by Kyverno it can pollute your dashboard.

You can tell ArgoCD to ignore reports globally by adding them under the `resource.exclusions` stanza in the ArgoCD ConfigMap.

```yaml
    resource.exclusions: |
      - apiGroups:
          - kyverno.io
        kinds:
          - AdmissionReport
          - BackgroundScanReport
          - ClusterAdmissionReport
          - ClusterBackgroundScanReport
        clusters:
          - '*'
```

Below is an example of ArgoCD Application manifest that should work with this chart.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: kyverno
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: kyverno
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    chart: kyverno
    repoURL: https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno
    targetRevision: 2.6.0
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - Replace=true
```

## Migrating from v2 to v3

In `v3` chart values changed significantly, please read the instructions below to migrate your values:

- `config.metricsConfig` is now `metricsConfig`
- `config.existingConfig` has been replaced with `config.create` and `config.name` to __support bring your own config__
- `config.existingMetricsConfig` has been replaced with `metricsConfig.create` and `metricsConfig.name` to __support bring your own config__
- `namespace` has been renamed `namespaceOverride`
- `installCRDs` has been replaced with `crds.install`
- `testImage` has been replaced with `test.image`
- `testResources` has been replaced with `test.resources`
- `testSecurityContext` has been replaced with `test.securityContext`

- Labels and selectors have been reworked and due to immutability, upgrading from `v2` to `v3` is going to be rejected. The easiest solution is to uninstall `v2` and reinstall `v3` once values have been adapted to the changes described above.

- Image tags are now validated and must be strings, if you use image tags in the `1.35` form please add quotes around the tag value. 

- Image references are now using the `registry` setting, if you override the registry or repository fields please use `registry` (`--set image.registry=ghcr.io --set image.repository=kyverno/kyverno` instead of `--set image.repository=ghcr.io/kyverno/kyverno`).

- Admission controller `Deployment` name changed from `kyverno` to `kyverno-admission-controller`.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `kyverno` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete -n kyverno kyverno
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## TLS Configuration

If `createSelfSignedCert` is `true`, Helm will take care of the steps of creating an external self-signed certificate described in option 2 of the [installation documentation](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/#option-2-use-your-own-ca-signed-certificate)

If `createSelfSignedCert` is `false`, Kyverno will generate a self-signed CA and a certificate, or you can provide your own TLS CA and signed-key pair and create the secret yourself as described in the [documentation](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/#customize-the-installation-of-kyverno).

## Default resource filters

[Kyverno resource filters](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/#resource-filters) are a used to exclude resources from the Kyverno engine rules processing.

This chart comes with default resource filters that apply exclusions on a couple of namespaces and resource kinds:
- all resources in `kube-system`, `kube-public` and `kube-node-lease` namespaces
- all resources in all namespaces for the following resource kinds:
  - `Event`
  - `Node`
  - `APIService`
  - `TokenReview`
  - `SubjectAccessReview`
  - `SelfSubjectAccessReview`
  - `Binding`
  - `ReplicaSet`
  - `AdmissionReport`
  - `ClusterAdmissionReport`
  - `BackgroundScanReport`
  - `ClusterBackgroundScanReport`
- all resources created by this chart itself

Those default exclusions are there to prevent disruptions as much as possible.
Under the hood, Kyverno installs an admission controller for critical cluster resources.
A cluster can become unresponsive if Kyverno is not up and running, ultimately preventing pods to be scheduled in the cluster.

You can however override the default resource filters by setting the `config.resourceFilters` stanza.
It contains an array of string templates that are passed through the `tpl` Helm function and joined together to produce the final `resourceFilters` written in the Kyverno config map.

Please consult the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file before overriding `config.resourceFilters` and use the apropriate templates to build your desired exclusions list.

## High availability

Running a highly-available Kyverno installation is crucial in a production environment.

In order to run Kyverno in high availability mode, you should set `replicaCount` to `3` or more.
You should also pay attention to anti affinity rules, spreading pods across nodes and availability zones.

Please see https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/#security-vs-operability for more informations.
