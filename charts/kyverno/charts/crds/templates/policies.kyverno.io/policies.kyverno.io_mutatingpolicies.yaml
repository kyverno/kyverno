                      on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                      object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                      object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                      it never skips the policy.

                      For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                      associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                      follows:
                      "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "runlevel",
                            "operator": "NotIn",
                            "values": [
                              "0",
                              "1"
                            ]
                          }
                        ]
                      }

                      If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose
                      namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                      you will set the selector as follows:
                      "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "environment",
                            "operator": "In",
                            "values": [
                              "prod",
                              "staging"
                            ]
                          }
                        ]
                      }

                                          For example:
                                          'pods' means pods.
                                          'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods.
                                          '*' means all resources, but not subresources.
                                          'pods/*' means all subresources of pods.
                                          '*/scale' means all scale subresources.
                                          '*/*' means all resources and their subresources.

                                          If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
                                          overlap with each other.

                                          Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed.

                                    matchPolicy defines how the "MatchResources" list is used to match incoming requests.
                                    Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".

                                    - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
                                    For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
                                    but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
                                    the admission policy does not consider requests to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 API groups.

                                    - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
                                    For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
                                    and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
                                    the admission policy **does** consider requests made to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1
                                    API groups. The API server translates the request to a matched resource API if necessary.

                                    Defaults to "Equivalent"

                                    NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based
                                    on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                                    object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                                    object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                                    it never skips the policy.

                                    For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                                    associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                                    follows:
                                    "namespaceSelector": {
                                      "matchExpressions": [
                                        {
                                          "key": "runlevel",
                                          "operator": "NotIn",
                                          "values": [
                                            "0",
                                            "1"
                                          ]
                                        }
                                      ]
                                    }

                                    If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose
                                    namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                                    you will set the selector as follows:
                                    "namespaceSelector": {
                                      "matchExpressions": [
                                        {
                                          "key": "environment",
                                          "operator": "In",
                                          "values": [
                                            "prod",
                                            "staging"
                                          ]
                                        }
                                      ]
                                    }

                                          For example:
                                          'pods' means pods.
                                          'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods.
                                          '*' means all resources, but not subresources.
                                          'pods/*' means all subresources of pods.
                                          '*/scale' means all scale subresources.
                                          '*/*' means all resources and their subresources.

                                          If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not

                                          Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed.

                                    Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".

                                    - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
                                    For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
                                    but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
                                    the admission policy does not consider requests to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 API groups.

                                    - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
                                    For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
                                    and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
                                    the admission policy **does** consider requests made to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1
                                    API groups. The API server translates the request to a matched resource API if necessary.

                                    NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based
                                    on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                                    object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                                    object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                                    it never skips the policy.

                                    For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                                    associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                                    follows:
                                    "namespaceSelector": {
                                      "matchExpressions": [
                                        {
                                          "key": "runlevel",
                                          "operator": "NotIn",
                                          "values": [
                                            "0",
                                            "1"
                                          ]
                                        }
                                      ]
                                    }

                                    If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose
                                    namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                                    you will set the selector as follows:
                                    "namespaceSelector": {
                                      "matchExpressions": [
                                        {
                                          "key": "environment",
                                          "operator": "In",
