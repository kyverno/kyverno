    policies.kyverno.io/description: Seccomp Profiles restrict the system calls that
      can be made from a process. The Linux kernel has a few hundred system calls,
      but most of them are not needed by any given process. If a process can be compromised
      and tricked into making other system calls, though, it may lead to a security
      vulnerability that could result in the compromise of the whole system. By restricting
      what system calls can be made, seccomp is a key component for building application
      sandboxes.
