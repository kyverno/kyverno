    policies.kyverno.io/description: Privileged containers are defined as any container
      where the container uid 0 is mapped to the hostâ€™s uid 0. A process within a
      privileged container can get unrestricted host access. With `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation`
      enabled, a process can gain privileges from its parent.
