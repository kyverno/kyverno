    policies.kyverno.io/description: Sharing the host's PID namespace allows visibility
      of process on the host, potentially exposing process information. Sharing the
      host's IPC namespace allows the container process to communicate with processes
      on the host. To avoid pod container from having visibility to host process space,
      validate that 'hostPID' and 'hostIPC' are set to 'false'.
