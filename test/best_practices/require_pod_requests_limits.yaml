    policies.kyverno.io/description: As application workloads share cluster resources,
      it is important to limit resources requested and consumed by each pod. It is
      recommended to require 'resources.requests' and 'resources.limits.memory' per
      pod. If a namespace level request or limit is specified, defaults will automatically
      be applied to each pod based on the 'LimitRange' configuration.
