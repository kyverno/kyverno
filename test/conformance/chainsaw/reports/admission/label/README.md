## Description

This test ensures that the EphemeralReport is generated successfully at admission, even when long GVR (Group, Version, Resource) labels are used. Kyverno handles this by distributing the GVR components (group, version, resource) into separate labels, ensuring they fit within Kubernetes' 63-character limit.

Kubernetes enforces the 63-character label limit during resource creation, and Kyverno ensures that the GVR components are split appropriately into distinct labels to avoid exceeding this limit.

## Why It's Important

If the combined length of GVR identifiers exceeds the 63-character limit, Kubernetes won't create the EphemeralReport at admission. Kyverno addresses this by:
Splitting the GVR components into separate labels, ensuring no label exceeds the size limit.
This approach enables the successful creation of EphemeralReport at admission.

## Expected Behavior

- Kyverno splits the GVR components (group, version, resource) into separate labels.
- The creation of EphemeralReport at admission will proceed successfully with the labels preserved within size limits.

## Reference Issue(s)

- Kyverno Issue #11547
