## Description

This test ensures that the PolicyReport resource is generated successfully, even when long GVR (Group, Version, Resource) labels are used. Kyverno handles this by distributing the GVR components (group, version, resource) into separate labels, ensuring they fit within Kubernetes' 63-character limit. If the GVR components are not provided, Kyverno use combines labels, which Kubernetes ensures stay within the limit during resource creation.

Kubernetes enforces the 63-character label limit during resource creation, and Kyverno ensures that the GVR components are split appropriately into distinct labels to avoid exceeding this limit.

## Why It's Important

If the combined length of GVR identifiers exceeds the 63-character limit, Kubernetes won't create the resource. Kyverno addresses this by:
Splitting the GVR components into separate labels, ensuring no label exceeds the size limit.
This approach enables the successful creation of EphemeralReport and PolicyReport resources, even with long GVR identifiers.

## Expected Behavior

- Kyverno splits the GVR components (group, version, resource) into separate labels.
- The creation of EphemeralReport and PolicyReport will proceed successfully with the labels preserved within size limits.

## Reference Issue(s)

- Kyverno Issue #11547
