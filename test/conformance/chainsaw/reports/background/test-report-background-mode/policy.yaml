      The restricted profile of the Pod Security Standards, which is inclusive of
      the baseline profile, is a collection of all the most common configurations
      that can be taken to secure Pods. Beginning with Kyverno 1.8, an entire profile
      may be assigned to the cluster through a single rule. This policy configures the
      restricted profile through the latest version of the Pod Security Standards cluster wide.
