    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Pod controllers such as Deployments which implement replicas and permit the scale action
      use a `/scale` subresource to control this behavior. In addition to checks for creations of
      such controllers that their replica is in a certain shape, the scale operation and subresource
      needs to be accounted for as well. This policy, operable beginning in Kyverno 1.9, is a collection
      of rules which can be used to limit the replica count both upon creation of a Deployment and
      when a scale operation is performed.
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    # This rule can be used to limit scale operations based upon Deployment labels assuming the given label
    # is also used as a selector.
