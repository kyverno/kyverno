## Description

This test removes multiple elements from an array iterating in ascending order.

## Expected Behavior

Element at index 0 is removed but element at index 1 is not (because when we removed element at index 0, the element at index 1 moved to index 0 and there's nothing to remove at index 1 anymore).
