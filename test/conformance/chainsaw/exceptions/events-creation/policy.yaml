    policies.kyverno.io/description: 'The '':latest'' tag is mutable and can lead
      to unexpected errors if the image changes. A best practice is to use an immutable
      tag that maps to a specific version of an application Pod. This policy validates
      that the image specifies a tag and that it is not called `latest`.      '
