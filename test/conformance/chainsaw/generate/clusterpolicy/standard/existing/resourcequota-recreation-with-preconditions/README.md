## Description

This test verifies that Kyverno properly recreates generated resources when they are deleted and preconditions need to be re-evaluated. Specifically, it tests the scenario from issue #13687 where ResourceQuotas with preconditions based on apiCall context are not being recreated after deletion.

## Expected Behavior

1. Create a Namespace named `test-namespace`.

2. Create a ClusterPolicy that generates a "default" ResourceQuota in namespaces with the following behavior:
   - Uses `generateExisting: true` and `synchronize: true`
   - Has a precondition that checks if there are no "override" ResourceQuotas in the namespace using an apiCall context
   - Only generates the "default" ResourceQuota when the precondition is met (no override quota exists)

3. Initially, the "default" ResourceQuota should be created in the namespace since no "override" quota exists.

4. When all ResourceQuotas are deleted from the namespace, the policy should re-evaluate the preconditions and recreate the "default" ResourceQuota.
