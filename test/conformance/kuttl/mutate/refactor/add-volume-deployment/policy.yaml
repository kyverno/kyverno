      Some Kubernetes applications like HashiCorp Vault must perform some modifications
      to resources in order to invoke their specific functionality. Often times, that functionality
      is controlled by the presence of a label or specific annotation. This policy, based on HashiCorp
      Vault, adds a volume and volumeMount to a Deployment if there is an annotation called
      "vault.k8s.corp.net/inject=enabled" present.
