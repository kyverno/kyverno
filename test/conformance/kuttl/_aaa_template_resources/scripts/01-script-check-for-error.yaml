## Checks that the manifests.yaml file CANNOT be successfully created. If it can, fail the test as this is incorrect.
## Note that the need for this type of script is deprecated in favor of Kyverno kuttl's feature allowing a TestStep to
## indicate that creation of a file should fail. See the BEST_PRACTICES.md file for an example.
