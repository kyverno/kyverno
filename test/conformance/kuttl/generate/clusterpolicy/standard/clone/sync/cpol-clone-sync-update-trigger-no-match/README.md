## Description

This test checks to ensure that updates to a trigger which cause it to no longer match the rule, with a generate clone declaration and sync enabled, results in the downstream resource's deletion.

## Expected Behavior

If the downstream resource is deleted, the test passes. If it remains, the test fails.
