Tests in the `cornercases` directory should typically correspond either to a specific Kyverno issue (please provide issue number or link) or a Slack conversation if no issue is logged. These are NOT standard tests for basic functionality but outliers or highly specific/esoteric combinations that have exposed a bug in the past.
