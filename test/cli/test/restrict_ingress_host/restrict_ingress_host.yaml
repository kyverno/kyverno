    policies.kyverno.io/description: An Ingress host is a URL at which services may
      be made available externally. In most cases, these hosts should be unique across
      the cluster to ensure no routing conflicts occur. This policy checks an incoming
      Ingress resource to ensure its hosts are unique to the cluster. It also ensures
      that only a single host may be specified in a given manifest.
