    policies.kyverno.io/description: 'By default, Kubernetes allows communications
      across all Pods within a cluster. The NetworkPolicy resource and a CNI plug-in
      that supports NetworkPolicy must be used to restrict communications. A default
      NetworkPolicy should be configured for each Namespace to default deny all ingress
      and egress traffic to the Pods in the Namespace. Application teams can then
      configure additional NetworkPolicy resources to allow desired traffic to application
      Pods from select sources. This policy will create a new NetworkPolicy resource
      named `default-deny` which will deny all traffic anytime a new Namespace is
      created.      '
