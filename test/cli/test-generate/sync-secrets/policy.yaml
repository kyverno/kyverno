      Secrets like registry credentials often need to exist in multiple
      Namespaces so Pods there have access. Manually duplicating those Secrets
      is time consuming and error prone. This policy will copy a
      Secret called `regcred` which exists in the `default` Namespace to
      new Namespaces when they are created. It will also push updates to
      the copied Secrets should the source Secret be changed.
