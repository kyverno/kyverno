# Policy Violations

Policy Violations are created to:
1. Report resources that do not comply with validation rules with `validationFailureAction` set to `audit`.
2. Report existing resources (i.e. resources created before the policy was created) that do not comply with validation or mutation rules.

Policy Violation objects are created in the resource namespace. Policy Violation resources are automatically removed when the resource is updated to comply with the policy rule, or when the policy rule is deleted. 

You can view all existing policy violations as shown below:
