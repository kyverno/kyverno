### Note
- The Helm CRDs was switched back to kyverno chart. To upgrade using Helm, please refer to https://github.com/kyverno/website/pull/304.
- With the change of dynamic webhooks, the readiness of the policy is reflected by `.status.ready`, When ready, it means the policy is ready to serve the admission requests.

- To add a consistent style in flag names the following flags have been deprecated `webhooktimeout`, `gen-workers`,`disable-metrics`, `background-scan`, `auto-update-webhooks`, `profile-port`, `metrics-port` these will be removed in 1.6.0. The new flags are `webhookTimeout`, `genWorkers`, `disableMetrics`, `backgroundScan`, `autoUpdateWebhooks`,`profilePort`, `metricsPort` (#1991).
