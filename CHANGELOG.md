## v1.8.0-rc3

### Note

- A new flag `disableBackgroundScan` to disable kyverno background scans (default value is `false`). When this is enabled, kyverno will not perform background scans and won't trigger continuous evaluation of policies.

## v1.8.0-rc1

### Note

- A new flag `protectManagedResources` to enable kyverno managed resources protection (default value is `false`). When this is enabled, kyverno managed resources can only be modified or deleted by the controller.

## v1.7.2-rc2

### Note

- A new flag `maxQueuedEvents` is added to the Kyverno main container, this flag sets the up-limit of the events that are queued internally.

## v1.7.2-rc1

### Note

- A new flag `maxReportChangeRequests` is added to the Kyverno main container, this flag sets the up-limit of reportchangerequests that a namespace can take, or clusterreportchangerequests if matching kinds are cluster-wide resources. The default limit is set to 1000, and it's recommended to configure it to a small threshold on large clusters. Here the large clusters are considered that a policy report has more than 1k results. 

## v1.7.0-rc1

### Note

- `status.ready` of the policy is deprecated in favor of `policy.IsReady()`. The implementation was changed to use `status.conditions` that offer more flexibility. The `status.ready` will be kept for a couple of releases until we remove it in the future.
- Deprecated flags have been removed.
- Flags that were overlapping with config map based configuration were removed (`filterK8sResources`, `excludeGroupRole`, `excludeUsername`). They can now be configured using the config map only.

## v1.6.0-rc1
### Note
- Helm charts are changed to enforce PodDisruptionBudget for multi-replica clusters and PDB is removed from install manifests.
- `anyPattern` for Kyverno validate policies breaks in Kubernetes `v1.23.0`-`v1.23.2`, and the fix is being tracked by this [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107688) and will be available in `v1.23.3`.
- To use `any/all` conditions for policies that use `preconditons` and `deny.conditions`, the user can go to this [resource](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/preconditions/#any-and-all-statements) as a good starting point.
## v1.5.0-rc1
### Note
- The Helm CRDs was switched back to kyverno chart. To upgrade using Helm, please refer to https://github.com/kyverno/website/pull/304.
- With the change of dynamic webhooks, the readiness of the policy is reflected by `.status.ready`, When ready, it means the policy is ready to serve the admission requests.

### Deprecation
- To add a consistent style in flag names the following flags have been deprecated `webhooktimeout`, `gen-workers`,`disable-metrics`, `background-scan`, `auto-update-webhooks`, `profile-port`, `metrics-port` these will be removed in 1.6.0. The new flags are `webhookTimeout`, `genWorkers`, `disableMetrics`, `backgroundScan`, `autoUpdateWebhooks`,`profilePort`, `metricsPort` (#1991).
