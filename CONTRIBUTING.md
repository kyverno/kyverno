## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) Sign off

For contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project, we are requiring everyone to acknowledge this by signing their work.

To sign your work, just add a line like this at the end of your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

This can easily be done with the `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message.

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

By doing this you state that you can certify the following (https://developercertificate.org/):
